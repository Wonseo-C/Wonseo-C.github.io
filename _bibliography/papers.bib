  abstract={Wi-Fi-based localization has many advantages for personal mobile devices as it works well indoors or in urban environments while consuming much less energy than global positioning system-based localization. The position of Wi-Fi access points (APs) is critical for the accuracy of Wi-Fi-based localization. However, the AP positions are often incorrect or unavailable, making it significantly challenging to use Wi-Fi-based localization for critical position-based services. In this article, we propose novel techniques that significantly enhance the Wi-Fi AP positioning by leveraging daily-collected real-world mobile data collected from six million users over a month. The proposed approach, namely Hexa U-Net, includes novel data processing by incorporating the received signal strength indicator and urban information. We also propose a novel loss function called hex-loss to train the proposed Hexa U-Net. Our evaluation results show that the proposed approach achieves 25 times higher accuracy for the Wi-Fi AP positioning compared to the simple deep neural network-based approach and 2.1 times higher accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art square grid-based convolutional neural network.},

  abstract={Fifth-generation (5G) technology is rapidly spreading to vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, which requires high reliability, high data transmission rate, and low latency to meet service requirements through a new frequency band called millimeter wave (mmWave). However, mmWave bands are difficult to utilize in a dynamically changing vehicle environment because of the propagation attenuation against obstacles. Various studies are underway to predict the path loss in the mmWave band on roads with many obstacles. However, it is still challenging to accurately predict the path loss in various environments because the existing prediction models either generalize the path loss solely based on measurement data or only use specific parameters. Recently, investigations on artificial intelligence have been conducted using various techniques that are different from the existing heuristic methods. Following this trend, we propose a deep learning-based path loss prediction that considers obstacles on roads and weather conditions in V2V communication using mmWave. To consider the various environments affecting measurement, we constructed a realistic simulation environment and collected data that we used to train our deep learning models. Our proposed deep learning-based approach achieves accurate predictions for path loss.},

However, the lack of access to a large-scale annotated dataset poses a great challenge, especially in the case of rare diseases or new domains for the research society. Transfer of pre-trained features from the relatively large dataset is a considerable solution. In this paper, we have explored supervised segmentation using domain adaptation for optic nerve and orbital tumour, when only small sampled CT images are given. Even the lung image database consortium image collection (LIDC-IDRI) is a cross-domain to orbital CT, but the proposed domain adaptation method improved the performance of attention U-Net for the segmentation in public optic nerve dataset and our clinical orbital tumour dataset by 3.7\\% and 13.7\\% in the Dice score, respectively.

abstract = {Background and objective
Glaucoma is one of the major diseases that cause blindness, which is incurable and irreversible, and it is essential to detect glaucoma vision deficits in treatment and check the progression of vision disorders in advance. In order to minimize the risk of glaucoma, it is necessary not only to diagnose and observe glaucoma but also to predict prognosis via indicators from Visual Field (VF) tests. However, information from the VF test cannot be directly used in clinical studies because most medical institutions store VF test sheets in Portable Document Format (PDF) or image files in different standards.
Methods
We developed AI-based real-time VF big data digitizing systems that digitalize VF test images in real-time in two ways; Semi-AI and Full-AI digitizer. The Semi-AI digitizer detects the VF text area with actual coordinates derived from mouse handler system. Full-AI digitizer detects the VF text area with Faster Region Based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN). After detecting the text area, both systems extract texts with Recurrent Neural Network based Optical Character Recognition. Semi-AI and Full-AI digitizer post-processes the extracted text results with in-system algorithm and out-of-system algorithm, respectively.
Results
Both systems used 325,310 VF test sheets from a tertiary hospital and extracted a total of 5,530,270 texts. From the 100 randomly selected VF sheets, 3,400 texts were used for the validation. Semi-AI and Full-AI digitizer showed 0.993 and 0.983 of accuracy, respectively.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of AI applications in detecting text areas and the different implementation methodologies of the post-processing process. In detecting text area, Semi-AI may be better than Full-AI digitizer in terms of system speed and human labor labeling if the number of types to be classified is small. However, Full-AI digitizer is recommended because it allows detecting text area regardless of resolution and size of the VF sheets, as the types of real-world VF test sheets cannot be predicted, and the types become more unpredictable when extended to multi-hospital studies. For Post-preprocessing, Semi-AI methodology is recommended because Semi-AI produced higher results with less effort and considered the convenience of researchers by implementing them as in-system.}
